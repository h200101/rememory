# Changelog

All notable changes to ReMemory are documented here.

## Unreleased

## v0.0.12 — 2026-02-13

- **Chinese (Traditional) support** — Added zh-TW as a seventh language for the recovery tool, maker, and bundle instructions. Thank you @JasonHK!
- **Portuguese translations** — Added Portuguese as a sixth supported language.
- **Language picker** — Both the recovery tool and maker now have a language switcher, so people can choose their language themselves.
- **Named and anonymous toggle in maker** — The maker UI now has a clear selector for choosing between named and anonymous bundles, instead of burying the option.
- **Security hardening** — Added Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS. Added size limits to ZIP extraction in the browser path (thanks @vnykmshr). Applied additional safety validations from a [security audit](docs/security-audit.md).
- **PDF polish** — Updated colours to better match the palette, added a coloured identity bar, and tweaked the header layout.

## v0.0.11 — 2026-02-11

- **PDF redesign** — The README PDF has a clearer visual hierarchy and now shows the recovery rule ("2 of 3 required") prominently, so friends know at a glance how many people need to come together.
- **Consistent colour palette** — Standardized colours across the website, recovery tool, and PDF to use the same warm, low-contrast palette throughout.
- **PDF screenshots in README** — The project README now shows example PDF pages so people can see what friends receive before trying the tool.

## v0.0.10 — 2026-02-11

- **Embedded manifest in recovery bundles** — If your encrypted manifest is under 5 MB, it's now embedded directly inside `recover.html`. Friends can recover secrets without needing the separate `MANIFEST.age` file at all — just open the HTML file and go.
- **Per-friend language support** — Each friend can now have their own language preference. READMEs and BIP39 word lists in bundles are translated to their language using official translated word lists.
- **Intro card in the recovery tool** — A welcome card now explains what `recover.html` is and how it works, making the first-time experience less confusing for non-technical friends.
- **Improved recovery navigation** — The top navigation adapts based on whether the recovery tool is personalized (from a bundle) or generic (standalone download).
- **PDF layout fix** — QR codes no longer break across page boundaries in PDFs.
- **Guidance on revoking access** — Added documentation on what to do if you need to cut someone out of your recovery group.

## v0.0.9 — 2026-02-10

- **PDF word list fix** — Fixed a bug where BIP39 word lists in the PDF could split awkwardly across many pages, making them hard to read.

## v0.0.8 — 2026-02-10

The biggest release so far — a new protocol version, word-based shares, QR codes, and a more flexible contact system.

- **Protocol V2** — Shamir secret sharing now operates on raw bytes instead of base64-encoded strings. This produces shorter, more efficient shares. V1 bundles remain fully recoverable.
- **BIP39 word lists** — Each share can now be represented as 24 human-readable words (similar to Bitcoin seed phrases). Supports English, Spanish, French, German, and Slovenian. This makes it possible to write a share on paper, print it, or read it over the phone — no digital device required.
- **QR codes in PDFs** — Each friend's PDF now includes a QR code containing their share. Scanning the code is the fastest way to enter a share during recovery.
- **Compact share format** — A new shorter encoding for shares, used in QR codes and other space-constrained contexts.
- **Flexible contact field** — The separate "phone" and "email" fields have been replaced with a single free-text "contact" field. Put whatever you want in it — phone, email, Signal handle, physical address.
- **Recovery UX improvements** — Better messaging when only one more share is needed to reach the threshold. Improved flow after real-world testing with printed PDFs.
- **Standalone recovery tool** — A generic `recover.html` (not tied to any specific bundle) is now available for download from GitHub Releases. QR codes in PDFs link to it.
- **Backward compatibility testing** — Added golden test fixtures for V1 to ensure old bundles remain recoverable as the protocol evolves.

## v0.0.7 — 2026-02-08

- **Slovenian language support** — Added Slovenian as a fifth supported language for the recovery UI and instructions. Thanks to @h200101!
- **Unicode name fix** — Fixed an issue where non-ASCII characters in friend names (accents, umlauts, etc.) could cause problems when creating bundle folders.
- **Path traversal protection** — Hardened tar.gz extraction against directory traversal attacks. Thanks to @vnykmshr!

## v0.0.6 — 2026-02-05

- **Release fix** — Resolved an issue with GitHub release publishing.

## v0.0.5 — 2026-02-05

- **Anonymous mode** — New option to create bundles without identifying information, for privacy-conscious setups where you don't want friend names in the bundles.
- **Redesigned website** — The homepage got a visual refresh with a cleaner layout.
- **Improved error handling** — Better error messages and guidance throughout the recovery flow.

## v0.0.4 — 2026-02-04

- **Web-based bundle creation** — You can now create recovery bundles entirely in the browser using `maker.html`, no CLI needed. Available on the project website.
- **Project website** — A proper landing page with documentation, hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **Smaller, faster recovery tool** — The WebAssembly payload in `recover.html` is now gzip-compressed and stripped down to only what's needed for recovery, making the file smaller and faster to load.
- **Bug fix: files lost when adding more** — Fixed a bug in the web UI where adding more files would cause previously added files to disappear.
- **Better translations** — Improved localization across supported languages.
- **Apache 2.0 license** — The project is now licensed under Apache 2.0.

## v0.0.3 — 2026-02-03

- **Personalized recovery bundles** — Each friend now gets a customized `recover.html` with their share pre-loaded and contact information for the other friends embedded. No more copying and pasting shares — just open the file and follow the steps.
- **Share verification** — The recovery tool now validates shares before attempting decryption, catching typos and errors early with a clear message instead of a cryptic failure.
- **Security hardening** — Tightened file permissions on generated bundles and added warnings when attempting to encrypt symlinks (which could lead to unexpected behavior).

## v0.0.2 — 2026-02-03

- **Auto-bundling** — Running `seal` now automatically generates friend bundles in one step, instead of requiring a separate `bundle` command.
- **Documentation cleanup** — Reorganized and improved the guides and README.

## v0.0.1 — 2026-02-03

The first release of ReMemory.

- **Encrypt and split** — Encrypt files with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) and split the decryption key among trusted friends using [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing) (via HashiCorp Vault's implementation).
- **Offline browser recovery** — Each friend receives a self-contained `recover.html` that works offline in any browser. No servers, no internet, no installation — just open the file.
- **PDF instructions** — Each friend's bundle includes a PDF with clear recovery instructions and their share.
- **Multi-language support** — Recovery instructions available in English, Spanish, German, and French.
- **CLI tool** — Commands to initialize a project, seal secrets, generate bundles, and recover.
