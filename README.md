# 🧠 ReMemory

**A future-proof, human-recoverable, zero-infrastructure cryptographic inheritance protocol.**

ReMemory encrypts your files, splits the decryption key among friends, and gives them a self-contained offline tool to reconstruct it together when needed.

## The Key Innovation

**Recovery works in any browser, fully offline, without ReMemory or the internet.**

Each friend receives a bundle containing `recover.html`—a self-contained recovery tool that runs entirely in their browser. No servers. No dependencies. No need for this project to exist in 20 years.

Your friends can recover your secrets with nothing but a web browser and their bundles. That's it.

**[Download demo bundles](https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/releases/download/v0.0.2/demo-bundles.zip)** to try the recovery tool yourself. See the **[User Guide](docs/guide.md)** for a complete tutorial.

## Installation

### From GitHub Releases

Download the latest binary for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/releases).

### With Go

```bash
go install github.com/eljojo/rememory/cmd/rememory@latest
```

Optionally, generate man pages:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/man/man1
rememory doc ~/.local/share/man/man1
```

<details>
<summary>With Nix</summary>

Run directly without installing:

```bash
nix run github:eljojo/rememory
```

Or add to your flake inputs:

```nix
{
  inputs.rememory.url = "github:eljojo/rememory";
  inputs.rememory.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
}
```

Then include in your NixOS configuration:

```nix
# configuration.nix
{ inputs, ... }:
{
  environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.rememory.packages.${system}.default ];
}
```

Or in home-manager:

```nix
# home.nix
{ inputs, ... }:
{
  home.packages = [ inputs.rememory.packages.${system}.default ];
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Project

```bash
rememory init my-recovery-2026
cd my-recovery-2026
```

You'll be prompted to enter your friends' names and contact information:

```
How many friends will hold shares? [5]: 5
How many shares needed to recover? [3]: 3

Friend 1:
  Name: Alice
  Email: alice@example.com
  Phone (optional): 555-1234

Friend 2:
  Name: Bob
  ...
```

### 2. Add Your Secrets

Place sensitive files in the `manifest/` directory:

```bash
cp ~/Documents/recovery-codes.txt manifest/
cp ~/Documents/crypto-seeds.txt manifest/
echo "The safe combination is 12-34-56" > manifest/notes.txt
```

### 3. Seal the Project

```bash
rememory seal
```

This encrypts your manifest and creates shares:

```
Encrypting manifest...
  ✓ Created MANIFEST.age (2.3 KB)

Splitting passphrase (3 of 5)...
  ✓ Share for Alice: SHARE-alice.txt
  ✓ Share for Bob: SHARE-bob.txt
  ✓ Share for Carol: SHARE-carol.txt
  ✓ Share for David: SHARE-david.txt
  ✓ Share for Eve: SHARE-eve.txt

Verifying recovery...
  ✓ Successfully verified with shares: Alice, Bob, Carol

Sealed! Run 'rememory bundle' to create distribution packages.
```

### 4. Create Distribution Bundles

```bash
rememory bundle
```

This creates a self-contained ZIP for each friend:

```
output/bundles/
├── bundle-alice.zip  (5.4 MB)
├── bundle-bob.zip    (5.4 MB)
├── bundle-carol.zip  (5.4 MB)
├── bundle-david.zip  (5.4 MB)
└── bundle-eve.zip    (5.4 MB)
```

### 5. Distribute to Friends

Send each friend their bundle. Each bundle contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.txt` | Instructions + their share + contact list |
| `README.pdf` | Same content, formatted for printing |
| `MANIFEST.age` | Your encrypted secrets |
| `recover.html` | Browser-based recovery tool (~5 MB, self-contained) |

**A single share reveals absolutely nothing.** But tell your friends to keep their bundle safe anyway—it's their responsibility to you.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rememory init <name>` | Create a new project |
| `rememory seal` | Encrypt manifest and create shares |
| `rememory bundle` | Generate distribution bundles |
| `rememory status` | Show project status |
| `rememory verify-bundle <zip>` | Verify a bundle's integrity |
| `rememory recover` | Recover secrets from shares |

<details>
<summary>Threat Model</summary>

ReMemory assumes:
- Your friends will only cooperate after you're gone (or when needed)
- At least *threshold* friends will keep their bundle safe
- Your computer is trusted at the time you run `seal`
- The browser used for recovery is not compromised at recovery time

ReMemory does NOT rely on:
- Any server or cloud service
- Any ReMemory website or infrastructure
- Any long-term availability of this project
- The internet during recovery

<summary>How It Works</summary>

### What Your Friends Do (Recovery)

When the time comes, your friends gather and use `recover.html`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    participant Carol
    participant Browser as recover.html
    participant WASM as Go WASM

    Alice->>Browser: Opens recover.html
    Alice->>Browser: Drops README.txt (contains her share)
    Bob->>Browser: Drops README.txt (contains his share)
    Carol->>Browser: Drops README.txt (contains her share)
    Browser->>WASM: Combine 3 shares
    WASM-->>Browser: Reconstructed passphrase
    Browser->>WASM: Decrypt MANIFEST.age
    WASM-->>Browser: Decrypted files
    Browser-->>Alice: Download recovered files
```

Everything happens locally in the browser. No data leaves their computer.

### What You Do (Sealing)

When you run `rememory seal`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant ReMemory
    participant Age as age encryption
    participant Shamir as Shamir's Secret Sharing

    You->>ReMemory: rememory seal
    ReMemory->>ReMemory: Generate random 256-bit passphrase
    ReMemory->>Age: Encrypt manifest/ folder
    Age-->>ReMemory: MANIFEST.age
    ReMemory->>Shamir: Split passphrase (3-of-5)
    Shamir-->>ReMemory: 5 unique shares
    ReMemory->>ReMemory: Create share files with checksums
    ReMemory-->>You: Ready to distribute!
```

### How Shamir's Secret Sharing Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Secrets] --> B[Encrypt with age]
    B --> C[Split key into 5 shares]
    C --> D1[Alice gets share 1]
    C --> D2[Bob gets share 2]
    C --> D3[Carol gets share 3]
    C --> D4[David gets share 4]
    C --> D5[Eve gets share 5]

    D1 & D2 & D3 -.->|Any 3 of 5| E[Reconstruct key]
    E --> F[Decrypt secrets]
```

The key insight: any 3 shares can reconstruct the key, but 2 shares reveal nothing. Not "very little"—mathematically zero information.

<summary>Cryptographic Guarantees</summary>

| Component | Algorithm |
|-----------|-----------|
| Encryption | [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) (scrypt passphrase mode) |
| Key derivation | scrypt (N=2²⁰, r=8, p=1) |
| Secret sharing | Shamir's Secret Sharing over GF(2⁸) |
| Integrity | SHA-256 checksums |
| Passphrase | 256 bits from crypto/rand |

**A single share reveals absolutely nothing about your secret, even to a cryptography expert.** This is a mathematical guarantee of Shamir's Secret Sharing—any fewer than *threshold* shares contains zero information about the original secret.

<details>
<summary>Failure Scenarios</summary>

| What if... | Result |
|------------|--------|
| A friend loses their bundle? | Fine, as long as threshold friends remain |
| A friend leaks their share publicly? | Harmless without threshold-1 other shares |
| ReMemory disappears in 10 years? | `recover.html` still works—it's self-contained |
| Browsers change dramatically? | `recover.html` is plain HTML + WASM with no external dependencies |
| You forget how this works? | Each bundle's README.txt explains everything |
| Some friends can't be reached? | That's why you set threshold below total friends |

<summary>Why ReMemory?</summary>

We all have digital secrets that matter: password manager recovery codes, cryptocurrency seeds, important documents, or instructions for loved ones. What happens to these if you're suddenly unavailable?

Traditional approaches fail:
- **Give one person everything** → Single point of failure and trust
- **Split files manually** → Confusing, error-prone, no encryption
- **Use a password manager's emergency access** → Relies on company existing
- **Write it in a will** → Becomes public record, slow legal process

ReMemory solves this with cryptographic guarantees:

- **No single point of failure** — Your secrets require multiple friends to cooperate
- **No trust in any one person** — Even your most trusted friend can't access secrets alone
- **Offline and self-contained** — Recovery works without internet, servers, or ReMemory itself
- **Designed for non-technical friends to succeed under stress** — Clear instructions, not cryptographic puzzles

</details>

<details>
<summary>What Friends Receive</summary>

Each friend's README.txt contains everything they need:

```
================================================================================
                          REMEMORY RECOVERY BUNDLE
                              For: Alice
================================================================================

!!  YOU CANNOT USE THIS FILE ALONE
    You will need help from other friends listed below.

!!  CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE
    This document contains your secret share. Keep it safe.

    NOTA PARA HISPANOHABLANTES:
    Si no entiendes inglés, puedes usar ChatGPT u otra inteligencia artificial
    para que te ayude a entender estas instrucciones y recuperar los datos.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This bundle allows you to help recover encrypted secrets.
You are one of 5 trusted friends who hold pieces of the recovery key.
At least 3 of you must cooperate to decrypt the contents.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER SHARE HOLDERS (contact to coordinate recovery)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob - bob@example.com - 555-2345
Carol - carol@example.com
David - david@example.com - 555-4567
Eve - eve@example.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RECOVER (PRIMARY METHOD - Browser)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open recover.html in any modern browser
2. Drag and drop this README.txt file
3. Collect shares from other friends (they drag their README.txt too)
4. Once you have enough shares, the tool will decrypt automatically
5. Download the recovered files

Works completely offline - no internet required!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR SHARE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----BEGIN REMEMORY SHARE-----
Version: 1
Index: 1
Total: 5
Threshold: 3
Holder: Alice
...
-----END REMEMORY SHARE-----
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Recovery Methods</summary>

### Browser Recovery (Recommended)

1. Any friend opens `recover.html` from their bundle
2. Friends drag & drop their README.txt files
3. Once threshold is met, decryption happens automatically
4. Download the recovered files

No installation required. Works on any modern browser. Fully offline.

### CLI Recovery (Fallback)

If the browser tool doesn't work for some reason:

```bash
# Download rememory from GitHub releases
rememory recover \
  --shares alice-readme.txt,bob-readme.txt,carol-readme.txt \
  --manifest MANIFEST.age \
  --output recovered/
```

<summary>Best Practices</summary>

### Choosing Friends

- Pick people likely to be reachable long-term
- Geographic diversity helps (not all in same disaster zone)
- Mix of tech-savvy and non-tech friends is fine—the tool is designed for everyone
- Consider their relationships with each other (will they cooperate?)

### Choosing Threshold

| Friends | Recommended Threshold | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| 3 | 2 | Minimum viable setup |
| 5 | 3 | Good balance of security and availability |
| 7 | 4-5 | Higher security, requires more coordination |

**Rule of thumb:** Set threshold high enough that casual collusion is unlikely, but low enough that recovery is possible if 1-2 friends are unavailable.

### Rotation

Consider creating a new project every 2-3 years:
- Friends' contact info changes
- You may want to update secrets
- Relationships change
- New cryptographic best practices emerge

Use `rememory init new-project --from old-project` to copy friend configuration.

You can verify the integrity of any bundle without trusting ReMemory:

```bash
rememory verify-bundle bundle-alice.zip
```

This checks:
- All required files are present
- Checksums match the values in README.txt
- The embedded share is valid and parseable

<summary>Why I Built This</summary>

Two things drove me to create ReMemory.

First, I watched [a documentary about Clive Wearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_P7Y0-wgos), a man who has lived with a 7-second memory since 1985. Seeing how fragile memory can be—how a single moment can permanently change everything—made me think about what would happen to my digital life if something similar happened to me.

Second, I've had several concussions from cycling accidents. Each time, I've been lucky to recover fully. But each time, I've also been reminded that our brains are more fragile than we like to think. What if the next accident is different?

ReMemory is my answer to these questions: a way to ensure the people I trust can access what matters, even if I can't help them.
